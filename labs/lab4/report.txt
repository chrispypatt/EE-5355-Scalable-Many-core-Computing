QUESTION:

Try running all four implementations using varying input combinations. Use at least 5 different combinations. Try scaling the number of input elements and the grid size differently having both low, both high, one low and one high, etc. Comment on the performance impact of each mode for the various input sizes. Explain why you think certain implementations perform better than others for various input combinations. In modes 4 and 5, make sure to also include the preprocessing time in your comparison, not just the kernel launch time.


ANSWER:


DEFAULT (GRID: 20,000, INPUT: 60,000): 
	mode 1:
		Launching kernel (CPU normal version)...2.640149 s
	mode 2:
		Launching kernel (GPU normal version)...0.015612 s
	mode 3:
		Launching kernel (GPU with cutoff)...0.015683 s
	mode 4:
		Preprocessing data on the CPU...0.001912 s
		Launching kernel (GPU with input binning and cutoff)...0.008004 s
	mode 5:
		Preprocessing data on the GPU...0.000096 s
		Launching kernel (GPU with input binning and cutoff)...0.007960 s

BOTH LOW (GRID: 1,000, INPUT: 1,000):
	mode 1:
		Launching kernel (CPU normal version)...0.002205 s
	mode 2:
		Launching kernel (GPU normal version)...0.000328 s
	mode 3:
		Launching kernel (GPU with cutoff)...0.000474 s
	mode 4:
		Preprocessing data on the CPU...0.000041 s
		Launching kernel (GPU with input binning and cutoff)...0.000832 s
	mode 5:
		Preprocessing data on the GPU...0.000096 s
		Launching kernel (GPU with input binning and cutoff)...0.000782 s

BOTH HIGH (GRID: 100,000, INPUT: 100,000): 
	mode 1:
		Launching kernel (CPU normal version)...22.025356 s
	mode 2:
		Launching kernel (GPU normal version)...0.190184 s
	mode 3:
		Launching kernel (GPU with cutoff)...0.100381 s
	mode 4:
		Preprocessing data on the CPU...0.003199 s
		Launching kernel (GPU with input binning and cutoff)...0.009930 s
	mode 5:
		Preprocessing data on the GPU...0.000109 s
		Launching kernel (GPU with input binning and cutoff)...0.009834 s

GRID LOW INPUT HIGH (GRID: 1,000, INPUT: 100,000):
	mode 1:
		Launching kernel (CPU normal version)...0.220005 s
	mode 2:
		Launching kernel (GPU normal version)...0.024790 s
	mode 3:
		Launching kernel (GPU with cutoff)...0.040484 s
	mode 4:
		Preprocessing data on the CPU...0.003140 s
		Launching kernel (GPU with input binning and cutoff)...0.041257 s
	mode 5: 
		Preprocessing data on the GPU...0.000134 s
		Launching kernel (GPU with input binning and cutoff)...0.041196 s

GRID HIGH INPUT LOW (GRID: 100,000, INPUT: 1,000):
	mode 1:
		Launching kernel (CPU normal version)...0.220281 s
	mode 2:
		Launching kernel (GPU normal version)...0.001431 s
	mode 3:
		Launching kernel (GPU with cutoff)...0.001076 s
	mode 4:
		Preprocessing data on the CPU...0.000075 s
		Launching kernel (GPU with input binning and cutoff)...0.002534 s
	mode 5:
		Preprocessing data on the GPU...0.000079 s
		Launching kernel (GPU with input binning and cutoff)...0.002620 s

*One thing to note, when running my code for GRID=100,000, INPUT 1,000, the 
verification process would say the test failed although the reference and computed 
values matched for mode 4 and 5:
	e.g. Verifying results...TEST FAILED at output index 49031, reference = 0.000050, computed = 0.000050
