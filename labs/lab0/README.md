# Lab 0:

The purpose of this lab is to check your environment settings and to make sure you can compile and run CUDA programs on the environment you will be usingthroughout the course.  In this lab, you will:
- Obtain a sample assignment package and walk through the directory struc-ture
- Set up the environment for executing the assignments
- Test the environment with a simple program that just queries the GPUdevice

## Running code:
```
make
./deviceâˆ’query
```

##Output:

The program was run on the UMN GPU lab machine #06. The result was the following output:

```
There are 3 devices supporting CUDA
