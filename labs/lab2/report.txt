QUESTION #1:

Briefly describe your implementation in one or two paragraphs as well as any 
difficulties you faced in developing and optimizing the kernel.

ANSWER:





QUESTION #2:

Consider a 100x100x50 7-point stencil that does not use any thread-coarsening or 
tiling optimizations. How much real computation does each work-item perform? How 
many global memory loads does each work-item perform? What is the ratio of 
computation to global memory loads for each work-item? (Consider as useful work 
only additions, subtractions, and multiplications that operate directly on the 
loaded data. Do not consider index computations.)

ANSWER:





QUESTION #3:

Consider a 100x100x50 7-point stencil that uses thread-coarsening and joint 
tiling optimizations such as the one you implemented. How much real computation 
does each work-item perform? How many global memory loads does each work-item 
perform? What is the ratio of computation to global memory loads for each 
work-item? (Consider as useful work only additions, subtractions, and 
multiplications that operate directly on the loaded data. Do not consider index 
computations.)

ANSWER:





QUESTION #4:

Briefly comment on the difference in computation to global memory loads ratios 
for the two cases.
